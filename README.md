# 🌍 Carbon Emissions Analysis

This repository contains work related to analyzing carbon emissions data as part of an ongoing data science project. The project is divided into weekly milestones, focusing on different stages of the data analysis lifecycle.

---

## 📅 Week-1: Data Preprocessing & Cleaning

### Objectives:
- Load and inspect the raw dataset (`climate_change_download_0.xls`)
- Handle missing values and inconsistencies
- Drop irrelevant columns and rename headers for clarity
- Store the cleaned dataset into `data_cleaned.csv`

### Outcome:
A clean and structured dataset was created, which serves as the foundation for further analysis.

---

## 📅 Week-2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Objectives:
- Explore the cleaned dataset using Python and Jupyter Notebooks
- Generate visual insights on carbon emissions across countries and over time
- Understand relationships between carbon emissions and factors like GDP, energy use, and population

### Key Explorations:
- **Univariate Analysis**: Distribution plots of CO₂ emissions, GDP per capita, etc.
- **Bivariate/Multivariate Analysis**: Scatterplots, pairplots, and correlation heatmaps
- **Trend Analysis**: Line plots to examine emissions over time
- **Top Contributors**: Identify countries contributing the most to global emissions

### Tools Used:
- `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration

### Notebooks:
- `CarbonEmission.ipynb` → Preprocessing
- `Data Exploration.ipynb` → Visual analysis & insights
